# OIBSIP
It's a GitHub repository for the Oasis Infobyte Internship program. I have uploaded all projects which I have made in this Internship Journey.

The projects are -

Iris Flower Classification
Unemployment Analysis with Python
Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
Sales Prediction using Python

About the Company
Oasis Infobyte is a community of diverse people coming together with similar objectives and ultimate goals. It's all about creating opportunities for leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering shared interests. We develop enriching environments and experiences that promote students' knowledge and well-being.

Iris Flower Classification
Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, 'Sepal length', 'Sepal width', 'Petal length', 'Petal width'.

Unemployment Analysis with Python
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour face. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good Data Science project.

Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives, and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.

Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
We have all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. In this project I use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam(ham).

Sales Prediction using Python
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. So, here I ve used linear regression model to predict the data.
